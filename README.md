This repository contains drivers fetched with [forked UUPMediaCreator](https://github.com/matebook-e-go/UUPMediaCreator). 

Normally you will receive the drivers from Windows Update, but if you want to install vanilla Windows image, you will need to install these drivers offline.

⚠ Some drivers or extra installation steps (e.g. pen and touch panel) are only distributed via Huawei PC Manager, use [driver-ota-client](https://github.com/matebook-e-go/driver-ota-client) to fetch them.

⏬ See [Releases](https://github.com/matebook-e-go/uup-drivers-sc8280xp/releases) for downloads.
